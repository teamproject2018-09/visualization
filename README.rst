This directory contains code and results for visualizing tweet data for the social media analysis of the Netherlands eScience Center of the team sprint of September 2018. The code and the results can be found in the subdirectory visualization.

The data visualisations are based on csv data of tweets which have been collected with the code in the section _collect-tweets: https://github.com/teamproject2018-09/collect-tweets 
... These data could not be redistributed here because of restrictions imposed by Twitter on sharing tweets.

The visualization directory contains five visualization images:

1. others-search.csv.png: number of tweets that mentioned esciencecenter from other users than @esciencecenter: per year with colored blocks indicating what percentage of tweets was written in what language
2. esciencecenter-user.csv.png: the same for tweets from the user @esciencecenter
3. nlesc-search.csv.png: the same for tweets that contained the string nlesc
4. twiqs-counts.txt.png: number of dutch tweets per year
5. eventCountsPerYear.png: number of times per year that the user @esciencecenter mentioned the hashtag for the yearly Dutch national eScience event
